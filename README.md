# Title - [Memory Game](https://nottohave.github.io/Memory-Game/)

I learnt to build a memory game using Javascript. This is inspired from Ania Kubow. I will style it more into my personal style.

# What I learned

I utilize:
push()
querySelector()
setAttribute()
getAttribute()
createElement()
appendChild()
math.random()
sort()
For loops

# Update
Bug fix: display nothing when user reselect matched cards.

Incoming modification in the future: when all the cards are matched, display all of them at the end along the message congratulation.
