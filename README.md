# Title - [Memory Game](https://nottohave.github.io/Memory-Game/)

I learnt to build a memory game using Javascript. This is inspired from [Ania Kubow](https://github.com/kubowania/memory-game). I will style it more into my personal style.

# What I learned

I utilize:
push()
querySelector()
setAttribute()
getAttribute()
createElement()
appendChild()
math.random()
sort()
For loops

# Update

7/24/21: display nothing when user reselect matched cards.
7/26/21: matching cards or unmatched cards will not display alerts.
Shorten the time of checking flipped cards.
